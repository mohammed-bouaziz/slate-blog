## Welcome to Serafyk 

Hello, I'm Mo, a computer scientist, AI researcher and software engineer. 

I started this space to share my work and ideas about artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning and their impact on our world. 

You will find detailed technical implementations, courses, scientific research papers explained (mine and others) and sometimes subjective opinions about the state of the technology, it's impact and the industry as a whole. 

Whether you're a technician, enthusiast or just passing by, you are welcome to read and engage. If the content is relevant to you, you can subscribe to the newsletter, and you'll receive new pieces every Monday, for free.  

### My Background 


![Mo's profile picture](/images/profile-pic 1-small.png)


I've been a software engineer for almost a decade now (still am), I've worked in various industries with corporations and startups. Some of them are Veolia, IBM, Coca-Cola and Shell, just to name a few. I'm also an AI researcher in the Computer Science Department at the University of Sciences in Casablanca, Morocco. 

I enjoy good music (Mark Knopfler finger picking a stratocaster), good company, Mediterranean food and trying out new games (the stranger the better).

I live in Paris with my wife (I'll update this when we have our first kid, maybe you can help with the name).

To know more about me, you can contact me trough the information below.
